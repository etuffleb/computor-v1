# Computor-V1

The goal of this project is to make a simple equation solving program. It takes polynomial equations into account. These equations only require exponents. No complex function. The program displays its solution(s).

## Example
The program solves polynomials of the first and second degree. Including those equations in which the number of solutions is infinite:

The program also contains a parser that shows where you need to correct the input
